solved slider problems today: 
the viewort can change size with slider now
the slider text color change is normal now
Also, changed all the functions according to the slider currently

remaining problems/other things to do:
reorganizing codes

slider still has problems:
	1) the text cannot strickly follow the slider, need to find a place to put a update in the label position

the gumball problem still unsolved, need to find a way to :
	1) bring the texture from rhino to omniverse
	2) import from rhino with correct orientation
	3) find transformation matrix for the camera after the gimball is added and transforamtion on gimball is performed

need to improve the viewport ui:
	1) how to guide the user through all the procesdures? create camera-> select camera-> set target point -> do projections
	2) need to add orbital option for the camera

solve camera recursion problems:
	1) subscribe to change in prims
	2) click load camera
