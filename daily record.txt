solved slider problems today: 
the viewort can change size with slider now
the slider text color change is normal now
Also, changed all the functions according to the slider currently

remaining problems/other things to do:
reorganizing codes

slider still has problems:
	1) the text cannot strickly follow the slider, need to find a place to put a update in the label position

the gumball problem still unsolved, need to find a way to :
	1) bring the texture from rhino to omniverse
	2) import from rhino with correct orientation
	3) find transformation matrix for the camera after the gimball is added and transforamtion on gimball is performed

need to improve the viewport ui:
	1) how to guide the user through all the procesdures? create camera-> select camera-> set target point -> do projections
	2) need to add orbital option for the camera

solve camera recursion problems:
	1) subscribe to change in prims
	2) click load camera

Conversation with Robert: incorporate in focal length and aperature (slider or string field and a set of common focal length)
17mm 28mm 85mm 200mm
This only applies for perspective

snap 
record history
add focus function

what done today:
added plane selection and target selection
fixed incorrect position of the camera dur to scaling of the plane
added two more views for orthographic projection 

Things to do in the future and problems:
can't directly recreate omniverse paint ui, need to find a new way to create the paint library
can probably still retain their ui, but need to add a default brush to the brush library
starts with orthographic proj and craeting planes for it
	- need to find a way to change display opacity of the plane, found the parameter, but need to create correct input
	- need to decide how large the plane should be, especially how high should the plane be
		- where should the plane be when it's top view
how to create own regular brushes
	- how to change the mouse event listener to:
		- when pressed, paint
		- when release, stop
how to distinguish ground plane and wall plane, is there a way to rename it
